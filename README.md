Today, I'm exploring Headless CMS with WordPress and Next.js! ðŸš€

Headless CMS allows for greater flexibility, separating content management from the front-end, which means you can build your site using any technology, like React or Next.js, while leveraging WordPress as the content hub.



Some key features of headless CMS include:

  * Seamless content delivery via REST APIs

  * Multi-platform support (Web, mobile apps, etc.)

  * Customizable front-end with Next.js for better performance & SEO

  * flexibility in managing content



It's a game-changer for modern web development, offering enhanced performance, security, and ease of integration.
